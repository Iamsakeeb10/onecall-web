## CONTENT CHUNK G — Final Content Audit & Full Verification

```
The ONECALL FIELD SERVICES LLC website is fully built and all real content has been integrated
(Content Chunks A through F complete).

Use @codebase to do a thorough audit of every file.

TASK: Search the entire codebase for any remaining dummy or placeholder
content, replace it with the correct real content, then run a full
verification pass.

1. SEARCH FOR AND REPLACE ALL PLACEHOLDER PATTERNS

Search every .tsx and .ts file for the following and fix any found:

Text patterns to eliminate:
  - Any text containing "lorem ipsum" (case-insensitive)
  - Any text containing "placeholder"
  - Any text containing "Your Company" or "Company Name"
  - Any text containing "dummy"
  - Any email other than: info@onecallsvcs.com
  - Any phone number other than: 123-456-7890
  - Any URL containing megafixx other than: https://onecallsvcs.com
  - Any address / location other than "Collin County, Texas" or "Texas"
  - Any copyright year other than 2026
  - Any "Home Services" tagline that doesn't include "LLC"
  - Any heading that reads "Heading" or "Title" or "Subtitle" without
    real content

2. VERIFY CONTACT DETAILS ARE CONSISTENT SITE-WIDE

## TIPS FOR USING THESE PROMPTS WITH CURSOR

1. Run Content Chunks **A through F first**, then run Chunk G as the final audit.
2. Use `@codebase` at the start of **every conversation** so Cursor sees all files.
3. Run `npm run dev` after every chunk — catch issues immediately.
4. If Cursor starts changing styles or layout, stop it and say:
   *"Do NOT change any Tailwind classes, styling, or component structure.
   Only update the text content as specified."*
5. If Cursor misses a section, say:
   *"You missed [section name] — please update it now using the exact text
   from the chunk instructions."*
6. Run `npm run build` after Chunk G to confirm zero errors before deployment.
7. The order matters: A (services data) → B (clients data) → C (about page) →
   D (homepage sections) → E (contact + footer) → F (T&C page) → G (audit).
